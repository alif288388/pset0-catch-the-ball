# pset0 Catch the Ball

This Scratch project is a simple catching game where the player controls a sprite that moves left and right to catch a falling ball. The ball starts at a random horizontal position at the top and falls downward continuously. When the ball touches the player, a pop sound plays, the score increases by 1, and the ball resets to the top at a new random position. If the ball falls past the bottom without being caught, it resets to the top to try again.

## Features
- **Events:** Starts with the green flag.
- **Loops:** Ball keeps falling and checking for collisions.
- **Conditionals:** Detects when the ball touches the player or falls off-screen.
- **Variables:** Keeps track of the score.
- **Sound:** Plays a pop sound when the ball is caught.

This project meets all of CS50â€™s pset0 requirements.
